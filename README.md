# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
The purpose of this code is to implement one of the earliest mainframe computer games, two-dimensional tic-tac-toe played on a 3x3 board between two users. The two users take turns placing X's and O's on the board, and the first one to get three in a row wins the game. The game also ends if all 9 board positions are filled or if it is impossible for either to win.
